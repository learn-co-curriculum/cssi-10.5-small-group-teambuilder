####End
* Sam needs to have his gummy lifejacket on and be inside the upright boat. 
* The oar is resting across the boat.

####Debrief:
* What was difficult about working with others?
* Could you have been successful on your own?
* Are there natural strengths in your group that you can replicate? Are there weaknesses that you can mitigate?
